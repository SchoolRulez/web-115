            <p>When you are first creating a character, you might become overwhelmed by the many choices you have for classes. Each class does something different, and which one you choose might decide how much you love or hate the game. Some players prefer short-range combat, while others like to stand as far back from the action as possible.</p>

            <p>I have compiled a short list of classes that I believe are beginner friendly, with notes of their expected play styles. You do not need to pick from my list by any means, play whatever you think you will like, the ones I am including here are just a starting point for those who are unsure.</p>
            <h2>Warrior</h2>
            <img src="../images/warrior.png" alt="human warrior" class="center" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="Human Warrior">
            <p>The warrior is a heavy-hitting short-range combat machine. They wear the heaviest armor in the game (plate) and make use of swords, axes, and shields. This class comes with the option of damage or tank specializations. As a damage dealer, your focus is all about outputting as much damage as you can into your target. As a tank, your focus is making sure the enemies stay focused on you while other players deal the damage.</p>
            <h2>Hunter</h2>
            <img src="../images/hunter.png" alt="orc hunter" class="center" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="Orc Hunter">
            <p>The hunter is a great beginner class for someone looking for ranged combat and a companion. As a hunter, your sole focus is dealing out damage with a loyal pet at your side. With your choice of gun or bow, and plenty of traps to pick from, you can be a formidable foe.</p>
            <h2>Priest</h2>
            <img src="../images/priest.png" alt="pandaren priest" class="center" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="Pandaren Priest">
            <p>The priest is a classic supporting class that can provide healing for other players, or act as a ranged caster with powerful spells. Whether you are playing alone or with friends, a priest is a versatile powerhouse that defeats foes and keeps others alive in the process.</p>

            <p>This is a full table of the different classes in World of Warcraft, with their range and my opinion on their difficulty:</p>

            <p>Once you have picked your class and run through the starting quests, you are often dropped off in one of the major cities in World of Warcraft. There are so many things to do and places to go! Before you go rushing off on a grand adventure, I suggest picking up some professions. Professions are trade skills in World of Warcraft, which allow you to gather or craft different goods. Some races have bonuses to certain professions, such as Pandaren which has a bonus for cooking. This does not mean you must pick up cooking as a Pandaren, but that you get a nice little bonus if you do.</p>

            <p>When picking professions, you have two primary slots and three secondary ones. For the primary professions, you could pick anything from alchemy to engineering. However, you can only pick two. You can change this at any time, but you will lose some skill in any profession you choose to unlearn. Your secondary professions are already decided, they are cooking, fishing, and archaeology. You can pick them up at any time, without worrying about them replacing each other or primary professions.</p>
