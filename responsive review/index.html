                <p>World of Warcraft has been around since it launched in 2004. In 2022, despite different setbacks and controversies, World of Warcraft has become an iconic game known by anyone who has an interest in massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG).</p>

                <p>It features the ability to create a customizable character in a 3D environment, with different classes and skills that make you more unique. It has extensive storylines, a world full of diverse characters and biology, and the ability to annoy other people who are also playing the game with basic questions about what you should be doing and what you can do in the game.</p>
                
                <p>Luckily for you, I am an experienced player that makes it my business to help fresh players. In the game, veteran users who are willing to answer endless questions are known as guides. They will have a green flag next to their name, so you know you can annoy them with all your concerns. For now, though, you have me to help you with some of the basics.</p>
